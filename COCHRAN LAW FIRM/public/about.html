<h3 style="color: lightgreen;">ABOUT THE FIRM</h3>
<p>Founded over 50 years ago, The Cochran Firm is one of the nation's premier plaintiffs' litigation, personal injury, wrongful death, medical malpractice, civil rights, product liability, and criminal defense law firms. With regional offices throughout the United States, The Firm is a diverse group of highly esteemed and experienced men and women, dedicated to bringing quality representation for injured people and their families.</p>

<p>The attorneys with The Cochran Firm handle the most challenging civil cases involving personal injury, product and drug liability, wrongful death, fraud, truck and automobile accidents, medical malpractice, environmental pollution, complex and commercial litigation, class action, mass torts and nursing home abuse. We are devoted to handling cases for all people with civil claims due to the negligence or wrongful conduct of others. Additionally, our criminal defense attorneys aggressively defend those clients charged with criminal offenses by developing strategies that will most effectively shape their cases.</p>
<p>All of our civil cases are handled on a contingent fee basis. This means our fee is solely based on a percentage of the money we recover for you. The initial consultation is free. If there is no financial recovery, then we charge no fee.</p>

<p>This allows our attorneys to represent individuals who otherwise might not have the money to hire a lawyer. Our criminal defense cases are handled on a case-by-case basis. The nature of the charge and the complexity of the case will determine the fee. A free consultation is given on all cases.</p>

<p>Our partners have practiced law in courtrooms throughout the United States for over five decades. We handle each case in the appropriate state, based on its licenses and regulations. We have access to the best technical support and resources available, which allows us to fight major corporations and insurance companies on behalf of our clients.</p>
